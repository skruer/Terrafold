the space station gives me way less ice/dirt then it actually says it does

Add planet graphics
	show factory, on the planet 
	show solar, around the edges 
	show coilgun, on the middle and always pointed west
	circle for building factory
	different color for building coilgun 
	different color for building solar 
	when empty, cannon rotates with planet 
	
Add meteor graphics back
Add ship laser animation 
Next System
	enabled when boss planet has 0 health
	10% difficulty increase to 1000%
	Auto next when complete
		Complete when all planets have 0 dirt and no ships or meteors exist 
Next Sector
	enabled when at least 5 systems have been completed
	resets difficulty to 0
	powerMult is 3^sector
	artifact gain is sector+1
Killing bosses give void crystals 
Unused void crystals increase hangar capacity

collect ships when sector is done
	if target is home and fuel is positive,
	don't take fuel, hide the timer
	can't change sectors without having all ships collected

Potential later upgrades:
	Increase max # of mines per planet, make it choosable down to 1

Computer
	Optimize Land - as is
	Modify Buy Ice 
		Every 1000 bought, ticks += 4, ice bought += 1
		Initial changed to 40
	Remove sell water
	Have better late-game scaling for find more ice sellers
		Every 1000 bought, cost/ticks *= 4, gain *= 5
	Find more Water Buyers
		Quadratically scaling science cost
		Shortish tick time
	Modify Bigger Storms
		Disappears when complete
		Unlocks Targetted Sunlight
			Improves ice melting rate, 10% at a time up to 100%
			Disappears when Complete
			Unlocks Targetted Humidity
				Grow ferns faster, 10% at a time up to 100%
				Disappears when complete
	Remove Build Robots
	Remove More Robot Storage
	Improve House Design Rework
		Double happiness bonus, cost increase 10x, ticks increase 3x
		Costs wood 
	Improve Saws
		Improve Cut Trees rate by 10%
		Takes lots of ticks, tiny amount of metal

Robots
	Build Robots
		requires 10 * # metal, 5k science * # of robots, linear tick increase
	Cut Trees 
		2 trees for 1 wood 
	Remove Modify Expand indoor water storage
	More Robot Storage - 
		Costs 250 land, Metal
		Stores 1 robot
	Modify Build Mines
		faster tick cost increase
		lower limit - floor(square(land)/10)
		Show how many there are
	Remove Turn Ore into Dirt
	Stuff Ore Into Compactor
		Expensive on ticks, no cost otherwise
		Puts 1% of ore into compacted storage
	Has Compacted Ore
	Grind Ore
		Takes flat compacted ore #
		Light on ticks, heavy on flat energy required
		Produces little dirt, littler gems

Tractor Beam
	Uses flat 1 energy for 1 charge
	At 100 charges, takes 1%+10 from passing objects,
	takes 10% from 
	has on/off switch

Battleships
	Rename Terraformers
	cost -> 30m oxygen+100k*#, 3000+200*# metal
